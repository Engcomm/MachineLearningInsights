# MachineLearningInsights
Lists the different papers I have published on machine learning and deep learning.  It will contain my presentations on deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing and semantics.  It will contain links to other good links , code and repositories in this space.  These papers are listed from latest to older papers.

Deep Learning Algorithms Based Text Classifiers.
Paper discusses the use of Different deep learning algorithms (Gated Recursive Unit and
Long Short Term Memory) for solving the classification problem. Experiments were conducted 
for different parameters and layers for these algorithms. Paper brings out the
architectures tried, results obtained, our conclusions and way forward.


Augmenting a Classifier Ensemble with Automatically generated class level patterns for Higher Accuracy.
Paper discusses a technique to enhance an ensemble classifier accuracy with an additional automatically generated domain specific class wise keyword list. A further improvement in accuracy is obtained when a semi-supervised approach was followed where the automatically generated class level keys are further reviewed by domain team before usage. It show cases the accuracy results we received on experiments conducted with different configurations. Paper has been published in IEEE and presented as part of the Artificial Intelligence IEEE conference held at Taiwan, 2015.

Building Accurate Text Classifiers.
This paper discussed the techniques to build a large scale accurate classifier for live production use. 
Key takeaways from this paper include:
How to build live production ready classifier system
How to overcome the data related challenges while building such a system
Solution architecture for the classifier system
Deployment architecture for the classifier system
Being prepared for the kind of post deployment challenges one can face for such a system. Paper has been published in as part of the SDIWC International Journal of Digital Information and Wireless Communications issue.

Building a Production ready classifier
This paper discusses the technique for building a large scale production ready classifier.  It brings out the data related challenges in dealing with real life data.  It also brings out techniques we can use to overcome such challenges.  Paper was published as part of the Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Data Mining, Internet Computing, and Big Data, Reduit, Mauritius 2015
