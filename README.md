# MachineLearningInsights
Lists the different papers I have published on machine learning and deep learning.  It will contain my presentations on deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing and semantics.  It will contain links to other good links , code and repositories in this space.

AugmentedClassifier -  Paper discusses a technique to enhance an ensemble classifier accuracy with an additional automatically generated domain specific class wise keyword list. A further improvement in accuracy is obtained when a semi-supervised approach was followed where the automatically generated class level keys are further reviewed by domain team before usage. It show cases the accuracy results we received on experiments conducted with different configurations.

Building Accurate Text Classifiers.
This paper discussed the techniques to build a large scale accurate classifier for live production use. 
Key takeaways from this paper include:
How to build live production ready classifier system
How to overcome the data related challenges while building such a system
Solution architecture for the classifier system
Deployment architecture for the classifier system
Being prepared for the kind of post deployment challenges one can face for such a system
