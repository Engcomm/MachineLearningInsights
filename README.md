# MachineLearningInsights
Lists the different papers I have published on machine learning and deep learning.  It will contain my presentations on deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing and semantics.  It will contain links to other good links , code and repositories in this space.

AugmentedClassifier -  Paper discusses a technique to enhance an ensemble classifier accuracy with an additional automatically generated domain specific class wise keyword list. A further improvement in accuracy is obtained when a semi-supervised approach was followed where the automatically generated class level keys are further reviewed by domain team before usage. It show cases the accuracy results we received on experiments conducted with different configurations.
