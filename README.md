It will contain links to other good links , code and repositories in this space.  These papers are listed from latest to older papers.

1. Intent Understanding in a Virtual agent
Published by ACM.
Presented at 2017 the 9th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing Proceedings at Singapore.


This paper discusses the intent recognition system we have built. This system is to be used as part of a virtual agent that can help resolve end user queries. The end user queries are of different intents – Request for action, Request for information, Report of some issue, General greetings. Intent detection is a key component of the virtual agent o decide which type the query belongs to and to further invoke the appropriate action modules. The system uses a combination of machine learning and rules based techniques. The rules based component can be used in an unsupervised mode with only the dictionary databases to be loaded upfront. Classifier is a supervised block which requires training data. The system has a feedback based learning which enables the system’s performance to improve with use.  This paper brings out the architecture of the intent recognition system, alternate configurations, results obtained and conclusions. The key differentiator of this system is the ability to use this system for different domains with minimal supervision

2. Deep Learning Algorithms Based Text Classifiers.
Paper discusses the use of Different deep learning algorithms (Gated Recursive Unit and
Long Short Term Memory) for solving the classification problem. Experiments were conducted 
for different parameters and layers for these algorithms. Paper brings out the
architectures tried, results obtained, our conclusions and way forward. Paper published 
as part of the International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Computing and Communication Technology, Bangalore, 2016


3. Augmenting a Classifier Ensemble with Automatically generated class level patterns for Higher Accuracy.
Paper discusses a technique to enhance an ensemble classifier accuracy with an additional automatically generated domain specific class wise keyword list. A further improvement in accuracy is obtained when a semi-supervised approach was followed where the automatically generated class level keys are further reviewed by domain team before usage. It show cases the accuracy results we received on experiments conducted with different configurations. Paper has been published in IEEE and presented as part of the Artificial Intelligence IEEE conference held at Taiwan, 2015.

4. Building Accurate Text Classifiers.
This paper discussed the techniques to build a large scale accurate classifier for live production use. 
Key takeaways from this paper include:
How to build live production ready classifier system
How to overcome the data related challenges while building such a system
Solution architecture for the classifier system
Deployment architecture for the classifier system
Being prepared for the kind of post deployment challenges one can face for such a system. Paper has been published in as part of the SDIWC International Journal of Digital Information and Wireless Communications issue.

5. Building a Production ready classifier
This paper discusses the technique for building a large scale production ready classifier.  It brings out the data related challenges in dealing with real life data.  It also brings out techniques we can use to overcome such challenges.  Paper was published as part of the Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Data Mining, Internet Computing, and Big Data, Reduit, Mauritius 2015
